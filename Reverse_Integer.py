"""
Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store
integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [âˆ’231,  231 âˆ’ 1].
For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function
returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

Example:
Input: -123
Output: -321
